	<p> <p>Poet: </p>

       <p>Dinakar Desai was famous as Poet. He commenced writing poems at an early age - in 1926 (approximately) by contributing to the small newspapers in the district.p</p>
        
       <p>While pursuing higher education he came under the influence of eminent professors and literary personalities like V Seetharamaiah (ವೀಸಿ), T N Shrikantaiah (ತೀನಂಶ್ರೀ), T S Venkannaiah in Bengaluru; and, B M Srikantaiah (ಬಿಎಂಶ್ರೀ) in Mysuru. This was the impetus to his poetry writing. </p>
        
       <p> With the encouragement of B M Srikantaiah (ಬಿಎಂಶ್ರೀ), ತಳಿರು (Taliru) - an anthology of poems by the young talents of the college was published in 1930. Dinakar Desai had his contribution.</p>
        
       <p> Dinakar Desai also started writing poems in his mother tongue Konkani in 1930.</p>
        
       <p> He tried and wrote poems in various formats, but settled to “chutuka” - four-line limerick. It is learned that he commenced writing “chutaka” sometime around the year 1955, and it became his signature format. His poems covered various genres and themes. </p> <hr>
        
       <p>Writer:</p>
        
       <p> Dinakar Desai, as writer had few publications. He wrote on some problems related to farmers, labourers, education, famine etc. and a travelogue. These works were not of much literary value, but proved useful and made good reading.</p> <hr>
        
       <p> Journalist:</p>
        
       <p> Dinakar Desai tried his hand as journalist also though it was not his cup of tea. He had no commercial interests either. He thought of educating the rural masses in the district highlighting the socio-economic problems confronting around them. Under his stewardship, Kanara WelfareTrust (KWT) commenced publication of Kannada weekly paper ಜನಸೇವಕ.The first issue was published on 26 January 1955. The paper was received well by the public. Ammembal Anand was the editor; leading literary figures in the District like Gourish Kaikini were contributing regularly. Dinakar Desai was playing active and leading role in writing critical assessment of the current affairs. The paper had also literary value. Most attractive and important item was a short poem of four lines (ಚುಟಕ) written by Dinakar Desai under the caption ಭತ್ತದ ತೆನೆ (bhattada tene). As mentioned earlier, the paper had no commercial interests and the Trust had run huge loss. The management of the paper thus took painful decision of discontinuing the paper, with the publication of the last issue on 2 August 1972. The paper was in circulation for more than seventeen years (18th year - 31 edition- 915 issues). </P> </p> <hr>
